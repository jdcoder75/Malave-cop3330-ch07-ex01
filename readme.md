##Help

This page is to help you understand how to operate the Calulator program

##Operations

This Calulator has the same basic fuctions of a regular Calulator.
Just type the operation you want done followed by a ";".

Ex: "> 4 + 5;"
  
  "= 9"

All the operations include

- '+'
- '-'
- '*'
- '/'
- '('
- ')'
- 'pow'
- 'sqrt'
  
##Adding Removing and Editing variables

If you would like to and a variable type:
- "let" to add a variable 
- the variable name 
- the "=" sign, the value you want it to set to, 
- and then ";" to complete the statement 
  
Ex: ">let x = 5;"

After each instance of you doing this, the Calulator will output a "=" as well as the value you set the variable to.

to see what is inside the variable, simple type the variable name followed by a ";" and then just hit enter

Ex: 
">let x;"
  
"= 5";

If you want to change the value of the variable then you would follow the same steps listed above, but just alter the number you want your variable to be set to.

You can also add constant variables. To do this, follow the same steps listed above, but instead of typing "let", type "const".

If you try to change the constant variable, the output will show you the value you tried to set it to, but if you type the variable name, and ";" , you will see that the variable is still set to its constant value.

##Quit

If you want exit the program, simple type "exit;" and the program will terminate.
